Problem Statement:
Coding Blocks, a coding bootcamp, needs a system to manage their students and teachers. 
The system should handle common properties and methods for all people at Coding Blocks, 
as well as specific properties and methods for students and teachers.
Requirements:

- All people should have common properties like name, email, and joinDate.
- All people should have a common method to format their join date.
- Students should have properties for course and batchId, and a method to calculate 
their course progress.
- Teachers should have properties for specialization and coursesTeaching, and a method to 
calculate their teaching load.
- The system should be easily extensible for new roles in the future (e.g., mentors, admin staff).
- Memory usage should be optimized, avoiding duplication of methods across instances.
